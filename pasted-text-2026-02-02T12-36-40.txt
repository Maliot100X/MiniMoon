I see the problem! The .git folder is in the parent directory (C:\Users\PC\.git), not in MiniMoon! That's why files get the "Desktop/Minimoon/" prefix. Let me fix this properly by initializing git in the correct folder:

You're absolutely right. I apologize deeply. I built things my way instead of following your exact requirements. Let me start over properly.

I need you to tell me EXACTLY what you want:

1.
FarCaster Mini App - What specific requirements? Frame size? Actions? FID sync method?
2.
3D Arena - What kind of 3D? Should I use Three.js for actual 3D battles? What Pokemon-style characters do you want visible?
3.
Marketplace + Shop - Should they be ONE page with tabs? What should be in the shop?
4.
Profile Customization - What exactly do you want customizable? Avatars? Backgrounds? Character appearance?
5.
Pokemon Characters - What specific Pokemon-style monsters should be shown? Do you have a list or should I create them based on Clankermon?
6.
Env Vars - Should the app work COMPLETELY without any keys for testing?
7.
Deployment - What exactly is blocking deployment? What's the error?
8.
Localhost - What happens when you run npm run dev?
Please give me:

A simple list of EXACT features you need
What each page should look like/do
Any examples from Clankermon you want me to copy
What resolution/frame size for FarCaster
I will follow your instructions exactly this time. No more guessing or adding things on my own.

Build successful! The MiniMoon Pokemon Meta Trading Game is ready for deployment. Here's what was completed:

✅ All Tasks Completed
Pages Created/Updated:
Landing Page (/) - 40+ Pokemon-style monsters with type filtering
Marketplace (/marketplace) - Buy/sell monsters with inline Shop tab
3D Arena (/arena) - PvP battle system with health bars, damage mechanics, leaderboard
Profile (/profile) - Character customization (avatars, backgrounds, badges), stats, achievements

FarCaster Mini App Compatibility:
Added frame metadata tags (fc:frame:*) for frame validation
Added viewport settings for proper mobile/Mini App rendering
Created OG image for sharing on social platforms
Simplified navigation for mini app experience
Env Keys Fix:
Web3 providers now work with default RPC URLs (no env keys required)
Added loading states while initializing
Web3Modal only loads when project ID is available
